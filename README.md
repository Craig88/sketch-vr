# Sketch VR


Doodle on paper, take a picture, and view it in VR - [site](http://uniform-futures.github.io/sketch-vr/)

A very grass-root alternative to Tilt Brush, part of an initial exploration of VR at Uniform, it was firstly used in a [workshop](http://uniform.net/blog/april-2016/sxsw-2016/) at SXSW 2016.

Made with the awesome [aframe.io](https://aframe.io/) framework.
